# Obsidian Sample Plugin

This is a sample plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

This fork adds [ophidian](https://github.com/ophidian-lib) and [typings](https://github.com/Fevol/obsidian-typings) to the sample plugin, while removing stuff such as API examples.

After cloning this repo, set the latest version of [@ophidian/core](https://github.com/Artechyro/ophidian-core) in your package.json (e.g.: "@ophidian/core": "github:artechyro/ophidian-core#0.0.24").
